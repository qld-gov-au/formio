# BoilerplateButton

This component is used as a boilerplate for helping developers to create their own custom component.

Please refer to this guide for creating custom component https://help.form.io/developers/custom-components.

Always refer to the formio.js source code to find more information about the component you'd like to extend.
For example this component is extending from https://github.com/formio/formio.js/blob/master/src/components/button/Button.js

This component is just for development purpose and will not be bundled in the custom component library script.
