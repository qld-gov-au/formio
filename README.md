## Development

Storybook is the main development environment in this repository.

### Local development

- Create a feature branch from `main`.
- Install packages with `npm install`.
- Start development environment with `npm run storybook`.
- Create / Modify components in `src/components`.
- Update `src/components/index.js` for new component.
- Lint and test with `npm run validate`.
- Push your branch and create pull request to merge to `main` branch.

### Remote testing in Squiz Matrix

There are 2 approaches to debug your feature branch in Squiz Matrix.

#### Approach 1: Deploy to CDN as a beta release

- Validate your feature branch with `npm run validate`.
- Review the latest tag number by `git tag -l`, and decide a new version number.
- Create a tag in https://github.com/qld-gov-au/formio, by running `git tag -a vx.x.x-beta00x -m "your message"` (eg. v1.0.4-beta001), with the new version number you just updated.
- Push the tag to remote by `git push origin vx.x.x-beta00x`, with the new version number you just updated.
- If your branch is valid and Github actions is executed, your branch will be deployed to CDN DEV environment after few minutes. You can check the status of deployment in https://servicesmadesimpler.govnet.qld.gov.au/bamboo/browse/QSA-FOR/deployments.
- In the Squiz Matrix Formio template, you could test your change by select `dev` in `Script environment`, and leave `Script version` to default or enter the version you just created, eg. `v1/v1.0.4-beta001`. Please refer to https://www.qld.gov.au/_resources/matrix-documentation/components/form.io-forms-v2 for instruction of using the Formio template in Squiz Matrix.
- If you've updated your feature branch and want to deploy to CDN and test again, you could remove the existing tag with `git tag -d vx.x.x-beta00x` (to remove the local tag) and `git push --delete origin vx.x.x-beta00x` (to remove the remote tag), and re-create the tag again. You may run into building error in Github action, you just need to re-run the failed task in this case.

#### Approach 2: Using Gitbridge

- Validate your feature branch with `npm run validate`.
- Push your branch
- A new brach will be automatically created in https://github.com/qld-gov-au/formio-qld through Github action.
- In Squiz Matrix, we have a gitBridge in asset `formio-cdn #248740`
- Sync the gitBridge with the branch you just created in https://github.com/qld-gov-au/formio-qld.
- In the Squiz Matrix Formio template, you could test your change by select `gitbridge` in `Script environment`, and leave `Script version` to default. Please refer to https://www.qld.gov.au/_resources/matrix-documentation/components/form.io-forms-v2 for instruction of using the Formio template in Squiz Matrix.
- If you've updated your feature branch and want to test again, you'll have to repeat the process of pushing and re-sync the gitbridge.

## Deployment

### Deploy to https://github.com/qld-gov-au/formio-qld

Push any branches in https://github.com/qld-gov-au/formio will create a co-responding branch in https://github.com/qld-gov-au/formio-qld.
Then you can use gitBridge to test the modules in Squiz Matrix.

### Release to CDN

- Update the version number in `package.json`, you can review the latest tag number by `git tag -l`.
- Create a tag in https://github.com/qld-gov-au/formio, by running `git tag -a vx.x.x -m "your message"` (eg. v1.0.4), with the new version number you just updated.
- Push the tag to remote by `git push origin vx.x.x`, with the new version number you just updated.
- Create a PR on this commit/branch, then this will trigger the github action.
- https://github.com/qld-gov-au/formio-qld-cdn `release` branch will automatically generated a folder for the new version.
- The new folder in the above branch will automatically deploy to bamboo https://servicesmadesimpler.govnet.qld.gov.au/bamboo/browse/QSA-FOR/deployments DEV environment
- To deploy to TEST/BETA/PROD, simply manually deploy the release in https://servicesmadesimpler.govnet.qld.gov.au/bamboo/browse/QSA-FOR/deployments

## Usage

You can consume this library either in Form.io Builder or Form.io Renderer.

### Form.io platform builder

To use custom components in the Form.io platform builder, please go to the [Project stage settings](https://help.form.io/userguide/projects#custom-js-and-css) and update the `Custom javascript` URL with the CDN URL of this library:

```
https://static.qgov.net.au/formio-qld/v1/v1.x.x-latest/formio-qld.min.js
```

<img src="https://qld-gov-au.github.io/formio/static/media/storybook-formioSettings.fbfb01cf.png" alt="share diagram" width="640" />

### Form.io JS renderer or builder

To use custom components in the Form.io JS renderer, please include the script **AFTER** the formio script.
Pleaser refer to [Form.io doc](https://help.form.io/developers/form-renderer#getting-started) for how to initiate your form application in a HTML page.

```html
<script src="https://static.qgov.net.au/formio-qld/v1/v1.x.x-latest/formio.full.min.js"></script>
...
<script src="https://static.qgov.net.au/formio-qld/v1/v1.x.x-latest/formio-qld.min.js"></script>
```

## Formio scripts versioning

The scripts files in the `lib` folder will be copied and hosted in the CDN, which are coming from these libraries:

- https://github.com/formio/formio.js
- @formio/premium (private repo)

We will need to sync the version of these files with the version of the QG form.io platform https://api.forms.platforms.qld.gov.au/#/.

At the bottom of the page in https://api.forms.platforms.qld.gov.au/#/, you can get the server version, eg. `Application: 7.3.0, Renderer: 4.14.0`

Based on the server version `7.3.0`, you could find the required version of all the dependency libraries in https://github.com/formio/enterprise-release/blob/master/API-Server-Change-Log.md#api-server-version-730.

eg.
formiojs@4.14.0
premium@1.17.1

Then you could copy the corresponding script files to the `lib` folder.

### Auto updating scripts

Github actions has been setup for this repo to fetch the latest versions of scripts from `formiojs` and `premium`, automatic creates PR to merge the latest script to the `main` branch.

At the mean time we need to sync the version with QG form.io platform, we could merge these PRs if the version is the same as the form.io server otherwise we'll have to ignore them.

## Folder structure

### src/components

Custom Formio components.

### src/helpers

Helper modules for integrate Formio into Squiz Matrix/consumer application.

### src/examples

Sample usage of Formio implementation in any applications.

### lib

Third party library files that going to be served by the CDN.

### builder

Backup/archived code snippet to be used in Formio platform.

## Alternative way to build/run

To not require install npm/node on your system, you can use the maven bootstrap method.

Install Java8+, Install Maven.

To run lint, tests, compile and build dist folder.

```shell
mvn clean install
```

to run storybook dev mode

```shell
mvn com.github.eirslett:frontend-maven-plugin:npm@storybook
```

## Coding practice

### Functional programming pattern VS OOP pattern

The custom component library under `src/components` is using OOP (Object Oriented Programming) pattern. As we are extending formio.js components which are already written with this pattern.

Other part of the project is using FP (Functional programming) pattern instead of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) pattern.
